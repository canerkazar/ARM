All projects, which I produced myself related to the CY8C4024AZI-S413 development board.

More info for this IC: https://www.cypress.com/part/cy8c4024azi-s413


Project 1 : Control of 4 LEDs on the board with capacitive buttons (CapSense).
Project 2 : An algorithm that is controlled by the capacitive buttons (CapSense) on the board, finds the product of two entered numbers and finds the closest prime number to the result.
Project 3 : Control of 4 LEDs on the board with capacitive slider (CapSense).
Project 4 : Control of 4 LEDs dimmer on the board with capacitive slider (CapSense) which communicate PC using UART.
